# 1. Project Vision & Mission

## 1.1. The "Why"

The Smart Bus Tracking System was born from a simple, powerful goal: to build a tool that solves a real-world problem for a school community and to make my mother proud. This system is designed for her school in Oman, with the primary mission of providing **peace of mind** to parents and **operational clarity** to school administrators.

Every feature and technical decision in this project should be measured against this core mission.

## 1.2. The Problem

In any school transportation system, several challenges create anxiety and operational friction:
*   **For Parents:** The uncertainty of not knowing where their child's bus is, when it will arrive, and whether their child is safely on board. This leads to worried phone calls and disruption.
*   **For School Admins:** The logistical overhead of managing user accounts, assigning students to buses, and handling parent inquiries about bus status.
*   **For Bus Supervisors:** The difficulty of communicating status updates to dozens of parents while also being responsible for the safety of children on the bus.

## 1.3. The Solution

This project provides a centralized, real-time Progressive Web App (PWA) to solve these problems. It connects the three key user groups on a single, easy-to-use platform.

## 1.4. Key User Personas

The system is built for three distinct user roles:

### a) The Administrator ("The Organizer")
*   **Who they are:** A school office staff member. There will be 3-5 admins.
*   **Their Goal:** To have complete control over the system's data. They need to manage all user accounts (Parents, Supervisors), create student profiles, and assign students and supervisors to buses. They are the system's "super users."

### b) The Supervisor ("The Guardian")
*   **Who they are:** A teacher who rides on the bus with the driver. They are responsible for the students' safety and attendance.
*   **Their Goal:** To manage their assigned bus route efficiently. They need to take student attendance (boarding and alighting) and provide a constant, real-time GPS location feed for parents to see.

### c) The Parent ("The Stakeholder")
*   **Who they are:** A parent or guardian of one or more students at the school. There will be ~800 parent accounts (one per family).
*   **Their Goal:** To have complete, real-time visibility into their child's journey. They need to see the bus's location on a map, know their child's status (e.g., on the bus, at school), and receive timely notifications.
