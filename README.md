# Smart Bus Tracking System ðŸšŒ

This project is a real-time bus tracking system designed for a school community. It aims to provide peace of mind to parents and simplify logistics for school administrators.

## Current Progress

So far, the foundational backend system has been built. This includes:

*   **Secure User Authentication:** A complete system for user login and session management.
*   **Admin Dashboard:** Core features for administrators to manage the system.
*   **User Management:** The ability for admins to create and view user accounts for parents and bus supervisors.

The project is now ready for the next phase of development, which will involve building out more management features and creating the user interface.
