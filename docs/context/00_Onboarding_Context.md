# Project Smart Bus: Onboarding Context

Welcome to the Smart Bus Tracking System project! This document is the master key to understanding the entire application.

## The Goal

Our primary mission is to build a high-quality, reliable, and beautiful real-time bus tracking PWA for a school, a project inspired by a desire to make the project owner's mother proud.

## How to Get Up to Speed

This `docs/context` directory contains the complete context of the project. To quickly onboard a new developer or an AI assistant, execute the following command from the project root. It will print the core documentation in a logical order.

### The Magic Command for AI Onboarding

```bash
cat docs/context/00_Project_Vision.md docs/context/02_System_Architecture.md docs/context/03_Database_Schema.md docs/context/04_API_Endpoint_Overview.md docs/context/05_Feature_Backlog_and_User_Stories.md docs/context/06_PWA_Reliability_Pledge.md docs/context/07_Architectural_Decision_Log.md docs/context/08_UI_UX_Design_Principles.md
```

This command provides a comprehensive overview of the "Why," the "How," the "Data," the "What," and our core engineering promises. The `docs/diagrams` directory contains visual aids referenced in these documents.
